# Simple-Disease-Modeling
A very rough, incomplete, and not very accurate disease modeler. Took around an hour or two (idk).

The whole thing is very rough; there's only an infected group and a suspectable group (wasn't sure how to implement a 'recovered' group), and there's probably some bugs.

Oh well who cares
